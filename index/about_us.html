            Hi and thank you for visiting Trikromatikz.  My name is Kaitlyn Willmore I am 17 years old and my passion is art.
            Ever since I was 5 years old my desire was to create art in different forms and share it with the world.
            I’ve been working at it ever since I placed a pencil on a sheet of paper and I’ve been studying and
            perfecting my craft now for 5 years, attending schools dedicated to performing and fine arts.
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            As a junior in high school I wanted to try something new and create something meaningful for my community.
            I joined a nonprofit after school art program consisting of 7 female artists that were devoted to empowering women
            as well as bringing awareness to controversial topics through murals.
            After the 4 months in the art program we created 3 portable murals about body positivity that illustrated the importance
            of loving one’s body and embracing their beauty despite people telling them otherwise.
            Once the program ended I created a few pieces for an art show at my school which then led to my class mates as well
            as my teachers asking if I could create pieces for them as well.
            I began selling my art work upon requests and it allowed me to do what I always wanted, share my artwork.
          </p> <br>

          <p>
            Trikromatikz serves as an outlet for me to be able to branch out and not only share my artwork within my community but to share globally.
            My goal for Trikromatikz is to be a place where you can find artwork that makes you happy.
          </p> <br>
